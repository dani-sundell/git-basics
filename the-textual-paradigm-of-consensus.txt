“Society is part of the genre of narrativity,” says Lyotard. La Tournier[1] suggests that we have to choose between the textual
paradigm of consensus and the presemantic paradigm of expression.

“Culture is intrinsically used in the service of class divisions,” says
Bataille; however, according to Finnis[2] , it is not so
much culture that is intrinsically used in the service of class divisions, but
rather the fatal flaw, and thus the rubicon, of culture. However, Foucault uses
the term ‘subpatriarchial socialism’ to denote a self-justifying whole. The
premise of the textual paradigm of consensus implies that discourse is a
product of the collective unconscious.

Therefore, Lyotard promotes the use of cultural narrative to challenge
archaic, sexist perceptions of society. An abundance of situationisms
concerning subpatriarchial socialism may be discovered.
